My first JavaScript project that I made during Laurea's (UAS) "Dynamic apps with JavaScript" -course. We had multiple choices and I ended up doing a TODO-list.

Our teacher demanded following things:

- Use JavaScript DOM
- Use LocalStorage or other means to store session
- Make it look nice (not a requirement tho)
