# TODOlist
My first JavaScript project. One of the projects made during Laurea's (UAS) "Dynamic apps with JavaScript" -course. 

// Project prequisites: 

General
The first project aims to develop a small-scale application that
runs in a browser and utilizes lessons learned from JavaScript.

The following are the high level requirements:
Only "native" JavaScript, no external libraries (JQuery, etc.)
The application uses DOM scripting and forms
The source code of the application has been published on GitHub. To do this, create a new empty repository.
The application is published on Netlify. (NOTE: The HTML page must be named index.html)

1. Todo -list
Design and implement a simple TODO application.

Application requirements:
The items entered in the field are assembled into a list on the page by pressing the button.
The content of the input fields must be checked for blank as well as incorrect (eg too short) content
Incorrect content in the input field causes an error message as well as an incorrect field highlighting (eg red border).
It must be possible to remove elements from the list and mark the task as done
The application CSS and JavaScript must be specified in an external CSS file
The information in the list is stored in a browser, eg localstorage
Additional functions:
You may also use drop-down menus and check boxes
You can implement a counter that shows the number of open items in the list
Try to come up with some meaningful way to hide and show elements in the app.
If you wish, you can also use the drag & drop functionality of HTML5 in the list
You can implement buttons (also shown at the bottom of the image) that only display active or completed tasks
