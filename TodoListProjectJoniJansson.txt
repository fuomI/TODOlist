TODO-list - Joni Jansson

My application is a TODO-list that uses JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

User can add tasks, mark them complete by clicking tasks or deleting tasks clicking delete button.

Tasks are stored to localStorage and they are brought back on each page load. Completion of tasks is not stored to localStorage sadly.

Infobox containing information about how many active, completed or overall tasks there are is attached below the TODO-list. 

UI of the site is niceish, most of the requirements are met and site functions well. I'd evaluate the site as 27/30, because completed
tasks are not saved to the localStorage.
